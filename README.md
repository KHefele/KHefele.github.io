# Visualizing Ovid's *Metamorphoses*

This project is a **visualization and educational website** on Ovid's *Metamorphoses*, developed as part of a master's thesis at **Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg (FAU)**. The website aims to create new ways of engaging with this canonical text and related artworks through an interactive digital approach.

⚠️ *Please note:* This project was created with self-taught knowledge of JavaScript, HTML, and GitHub. It is (currently) not optimized for mobile use.

## 🎯 Project Goals

The goal of this project is to explore innovative ways of accessing *Metamorphoses* and its associated artworks. Using a **web-based application (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)**, this visualization presents centuries-old knowledge in a dynamic format that encourages iterative exploration and inspires new questions about this classical work.

Two main approaches structure this visualization:

1. **Text-Image Edition** – The project establishes stronger connections between *Metamorphoses* and the artistic works inspired by it.
2. **Knowledge-Based Categorization** – Selected transformations are arranged based on different knowledge categories (e.g., geographic setting, taxonomy of transformed beings, causal background). These categories can also be interlinked for deeper exploration.

Due to the extensive scope of *Metamorphoses*, the project focuses on **60 selected transformations and related artworks** as an exemplary dataset. The application is currently in a **prototype phase**, primarily demonstrating the feasibility of this approach.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** – No external libraries were used, as the goal was to explore these technologies from the ground up.
